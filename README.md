1. `olist_order_items_dataset`
2. `olist_orders_dataset`
3. `olist_order_payments_dataset`
4. `olist_order_reviews_dataset`
5. `olist_products_dataset`
6. `olist_customers_dataset`
7. `olist_sellers_dataset`
8. `olist_geolocation_dataset`
9. `olist_category_dataset`

## Data Dictionary

Olist provides a **comprehensive and well-structured data dictionary** that describes each variable across all tables.

This documentation [Data Dictionary.pdf](https://github.com/khadija198/Olist-E-commerce-Data-Analysis/blob/26cf8ed90bc9e5e86bd84980d66129e44f7eadd5/Data%20Dictionary.pdf)
:

* Explains the meaning and role of each feature
* Helps ensure correct interpretation of the data
* Facilitates navigation and understanding of relationships between tables

The data dictionary is essential for conducting accurate analyses and building reliable insights.

## Business Questions

### Global Performance

* What is the total revenue and how does it evolve over time?
* How many orders are received, and how does this change month by month?
* How many customers and sellers are active on the platform?
* Are orders delivered on time, or is there a high rate of late deliveries?
* What is the level of customer satisfaction (satisfied vs. unsatisfied)?
* Where are customers geographically located?

---

### Product Performance

* Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
* How many products are sold, and across how many categories?
* How do monthly order volumes change over time (2017 vs. 2018)?
* What is the average order value (AOV)?
* Which payment methods are most frequently used?
* How does revenue compare to the number of orders for each product category?

---

### Logistics Performance

* What is the average delivery time (ADT), and is it efficient?
* What percentage of orders are delivered on time (OTD)?
* What is the average transportation cost, and what factors influence it?
* How are operational times distributed (order approval, preparation, transportation)?
* Is there a correlation between product weight and transportation cost?
* Which states have the fastest and slowest delivery times?

---

## Customer Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

After exploratory analysis and dashboard creation, we observed that **customer retention was relatively low**.

To better understand the underlying reasons, we conducted a **sentiment analysis on customer reviews**, which is presented in the final dashboard.

This analysis highlights the main drivers of dissatisfaction, including:

* Product quality issues
* Delivery delays
* Customer service challenges

### Key Questions Addressed

* Which product categories receive the most negative reviews?
* What are the main reasons behind customer dissatisfaction?
* Which themes dominate negative feedback (product quality, delivery issues, customer service)?
* Which product categories are most affected by negative sentiment?

---

## Deliverables

* Cleaned and structured datasets
* Exploratory and analytical notebooks
* NLP sentiment analysis
* Time-series forecasting model
* Interactive Power BI dashboards

Additional ML models – predictive and segmentation analyses

🔍 **Data Quality & Exploration**

✅ 1. Missing Values

For each table:

Missing value count

Percentage visualization

Cleaning strategy (drop, impute, correct)

Tables analyzed:
orders, order_items, customers, products, sellers, geolocation, reviews, payment

✅ 2. Column Types

Standardization of:

dates → datetime

identifiers → string

monetary fields → float

categories → categorical

✅ 3. Outlier Detection

Applied to: payment_value, price, freight_value, delivery time metrics

✅ 4. Duplicate Detection

For each table:

➤ Identification of duplicate records.

➤ Count of duplicates.

➤ Removal or consolidation.

Tables concerned: same as above.

✅ 5. Order Timeline Analysis

Differences calculated between:

purchase → approval

approval → carrier pickup

pickup → delivery

actual vs. estimated delivery

Objective:

➤ Identify delivery delays.

➤ Detect problematic orders.

➤ Link delays with low ratings.

❗ Missing Orders in order_items

Detection of orders with no associated items, indicating:

Algorithm: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

n_components: 3 topics

➤ Goal: Identify major themes among dissatisfied customers

➤ Process: cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal

🎯 Strategic Business Recommendations

Based on product quality analysis, delivery performance, and NLP insights, several improvement levers were identified.

🔧 1. Issue: Poor Product Quality & Weak Customer Service

Customer reviews and the LDA model reveal major dissatisfaction factors:

- Poor product quality.

- Slow customer support.

- Frequent delivery delays.
